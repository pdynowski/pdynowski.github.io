How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I found the process very smooth and easy - generally, the creative part seemed simpler than it did on my own, and coding is definitely sped up when the navigator can look tiny, specific things up for the driver instead of the driver having to slow down and look them up instead of coding.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
I found having a prototype simplified the HTML development considerably; splitting the design and coding seems to make both portions flow more smoothly.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Basic information regarding the page in the header portion (author, blog title, links to other articles), and specific info - ie, the blog post itself - in the main section

What new semantic elements did you learn about, if any?
Specific section tags (header, footer, section, etc) rather than the very general "div". It feels like that will make HTML much easier to maintain.
