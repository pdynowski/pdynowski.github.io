      <p id="main-title">Classes in Ruby</p>
      <p id="subtitle">Designing blueprints for your objects</p>
      <p id="date">Nov 26, 2015</p>

        <p class="question">Objects? Classes? What's going on, here?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">Most generally, an <i>object</i> is a data
          structure that contains both data (stored in <i>instance
          variables</i> in Ruby) and ways to work with that data
          (<i>methods</i>, in Ruby). A <i>class</i>, then, provides a
          specific model for an object - it defines the specific data and
          methods that the object will use when it is <i>instantiated</i>. To
          follow this one more step, in Ruby, to create an object, you
          instantiate a class by calling the Class.<i>new</i> method.
        </p>
         <p class="question">So, what happens when I call Class.new?
          </p>

          <p class="answer">Well, the first thing that happens is that space
          is allocated for the new object - all the variables and methods are
          assigned a spot in memory. After that, the initialize method from
          your class definition will be called. Note here that, every time you
          call Class.new, a different instance of your class will be
          instantiated - that is, the new object will have an entirely
          different location memory, and will not (generally) share variables
          with any other instance of the class.

        </p>
         <p class="question">Generally?
          </p>

          <p class="answer">

            There are specific items - called class variables and class
            methods - that are shared among all instances of a class. For
            instance, Class.new is actually a class method - all classes are
            objects of class Class, which provides the #new method to allow
            Ruby users to create new objects. Also, you may wish to use a
            class variable to, say, track the total number of instances of the
            class that the program has instantiated.

        </p>
        <p class="question">All classes are what now?
          </p>

          <p class="answer">

            Yeah. They're objects of class Class. It makes sense when you
            think about it, but I'm not sure how vital it is to know in
            general.

        </p>
          <p class="question">...ok. Can you show me one of these classes?
          </p>

          <p class="answer">

            Oh, if you insist. As I sit here, I'm staring at a wall covered in
            books, so, let's make a book class. And, since we're a tech-savvy
            crowd, let's make it an e-book. So, we're going to assume that we
            have a representation of the book in memory, for these
            purposes.<br><br>

            What do we need to know? Probably, we'd like to track the author,
            title, and number of pages in a book. Also the page of the book
            we're on. Maybe, we'd even like to track the last time we read a
            page. These will be our instance variables. We'll throw a class
            variable in, as well - we'll track our total number of books.Sound
            good?<br><br>

            Ok. On to methods - we'd like to be able to see the information
            about the book, and to display the text from the current page.
            We'd also like to be able to select a page to see, and to turn the
            pages forward and backward. Finally, being able to open and close
            the book seems like a solid idea. So, let's look at what we have:
              
              <div id="codeblock"><pre><code>
class Book

  @@book_count
  @information
  @current_page
  @last_time_read

  def initialize(book_title, book_author, number_pages)
    @@book_count +=1
    @information = {title: book_title, author: book_author, pages: number_pages}
    @current_page = 0
    @last_time_read = 0
  end

  attr_reader :information, :current_page

  def display(page)
    p #code to retrieve page from memory
  end

  def turn_to(page)
    @current_page = page
    display(current_page)
  end

  def page_forward
    @current_page += 1
    display(@current_page)
  end

  def page_backward
    @current_page -=1
    display(@current_page)
  end

  def open_book
    display(current_page)
  end

  def close_book
    @last_time_read = #code to insert current time
  end

end
            </code></pre></div>

            <p class="question">Can we review this a bit?
          </p>

          <p class="answer">

            Sure. Each book we initialize - each <i>instance</i> of class Book
            - have several variables relating only to that instance; i.e.,
            instance variables. In our Book class, our instance variables are
            the information hash, the current page, and the last time the book
            was read. These are important pieces of information for each book,
            but the information for <u>Jurassic Park</u> doesn't matter at all
            for <u>Guns, Germs, and Steel</u>, and vice-versa. Instance
            methods, now - all the things defined in def...end blocks - are
            what you use to control the behavior of an instantiated book
            object; they don't work unless you've created a book object for
            them to work on. 

        </p>
        
            Crystal clear, I hope. Thanks for reading this far, and please let
            me know if I've made any mistakes, left anything vital out, or in
            any other way muddled the issue.
